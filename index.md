# Lab Exercise-1 Question 6

<b>Q. Introduce the selected “Data Set” from the [awesome-datascience] GitHub (with the data source URL) and describe its potential applications and values.</b>

Answer: Out of various Data set I have selected “UCI Machine Learning Repository”.

Url: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php

When it comes to the dataset the UCI repository is the first option that pops into everyone’s mind.
This is the trusted repository maintained by the University of California Irvine, it contains 622 data sets and offers data service to the machine learning community. All the data set are structured, and stored in table-separated value. 
This repository has a huge collection of varieties of data set, dataset, theories, data generators, etc. This repository is supported by the national scientific foundation, which is in collaboration with rexa.info.

Application of using the UCI repository, you can choose data set based on various factors such as:

Problems which are classification, regression, clustering

Attribute Type: Data set contains categorical, Numerical, mixed 

Data Type: Multivariate, Univariate, Sequential, Time-Series, Text, Domain Theory

Field: Life Sciences, physical sciences, computer science/ computer engineering, social sciences, Business, and others.

Number of data set features: less than 10, between 10 to 100, greater than 100

Instances of the data set: less than 100, between 100 to 1000, and greater than 1000

My personal experience with UCI repository: I have worked on 5-6 data sets of UCI of different sizes. Because of a larger number of features I was able to learn and experiment with different problems that I created by myself. 


<b>Q. Introduce ONE selected “free-data-science-book” with its URL and author/institute
information. Explain briefly why you are interested in this book.</b>

Answer:

 URL of the ebook: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VmkAAGOYCTORq1wxSQqy255qLJjTNvBI/view

Authors: Joseph K. Blitzstein and Jessica Hwang Harvard University and Stanford University.

The reason I have an interest in this book is that I’m interested in data science and the machine learning field. Statistics is fundamental to machine learning algorithms. With the help of statistical theorems like the law of large numbers, distribution theorem, probability, etc are used to identify, forecast, and evaluate data patterns in data science.
